### AI Mainz (e.V. soon)

We are a group of (PhD) students meeting since 2020 discussing various aspects of "good" uses of AI, e.g., using prediction techniques to optimize the production of sustainable fuels or keeping each other up to date on current affairs in AI. We meet ~ once a month. Let me know if you are interested in joining. [Some of us founded a company](https://aira-holding.de/#/) and multiple collaborations with industry and academic partners already emerged (more to come).
