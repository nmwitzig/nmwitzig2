#### Cognitive Imprecision and Altruistic Preferences
[*draft in preparation*]
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse_noise" class="collapsed" aria-expanded="false">[abstract]</a>
<div id="collapse_noise" class="panel-collapse collapse" style=""> <text style="font-size:smaller">
I study altruistic choices --- trading-off own vs. another persons's payoff --- through the lens of a cognitively noisy Bayesian decision-maker. I propose a simple choice framework where cognitive noise can bias altruistic decisions. I run an experiment featuring a between-subject manipulation of cognitive noise, where the altruistic trade-off is cognitively more difficult. The treatment group shows a flatter association between changes in payoffs and choices and decides significantly more often for the other person's payment, i.e., is more altruistic. I explore the origins of this effect both with structural estimations and a number-comparison task, mirroring the "arithmetics" of the altruism choices absent any preference dimension. I find comparable treatment effects, which hints at an adaption of the perception of numerical magnitudes to the statistics of the experiment trials as the driver of the treatment effect. The structural estimations support this interpretation. I further explore the implications of a "cognitive lens" to altruism decisions and, e.g., find positive associations between measures of cognitive ability and choice variability.

#### Strategic Uncertainty and Time Pressure in Professional Chess
*with Johannes Carow*<br>
[[Web-App]](https://share.streamlit.io/nmwitzig/streamlit-chess/main/app.py) [*draft available upon request*] <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse_chess" class="collapsed" aria-expanded="false">[abstract]</a>
<div id="collapse_chess" class="panel-collapse collapse" style=""> <text style="font-size:smaller">
Strategic decisions often need to be made under considerable time pressure. While the literature has studied the effect of time pressure in laboratory settings in various domains, much less is known about how highly proficient decision-makers react to time pressure in high-stake settings. Here, we address this gap and study the impact of time pressure on strategic decisions by professional chess players. We propose a novel machine-learning-based measure for the move-specific degree of strategic uncertainty in chess. We apply our measure to the 2013-2021 FIDE Chess World Cups which allow for exogenous variation in thinking time. We find that time pressure consistently leads chess players to opt for uncertainty-averse moves more frequently. In addition, we find correlational evidence for strategic loss aversion. Our results suggest that also high-proficiency decision-makers react to context factors such as time pressure. We discuss whether these effects originate from genuine preference shifts or adaptations of the allocation of time during a chess game.

#### Behavioral Time Choices in Speed-Accuracy Trade-offs
*with Alexander Dzionara*<br>
[[pre-registration]](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7748) [*draft available upon request*] <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse_time" class="collapsed" aria-expanded="false">[abstract]</a>
<div id="collapse_time" class="panel-collapse collapse" style=""> <text style="font-size:smaller">
In many economic contexts, people need to solve trade-offs between doing an activity (e.g., solving a task at work) faster and doing it better. While time choices in speed-accuracy trade-offs have been extensively studied in cognitive science for motor-response and perception tasks, little evidence is available for economic decision-making. Furthermore, the impact of behavioral biases on time choices in such environments has yet to be explored. In this paper, we present a theoretical model linking time choices in speed-accuracy trade-offs to agents' abilities, subjective beliefs, and uncertainty attitudes. We test the predictions of the model in an experiment for two distinct, but mathematically identical, environments: prospective time choices before solving a task and simultaneous time choices while solving a task. We find that overconfidence and uncertainty aversion affect time choices in the prospective but not in the simultaneous environment. This is in line with a literature in psychology and economics documenting differences between determinants of planned and actual actions. We discuss potential practical and policy implications based on this finding.
